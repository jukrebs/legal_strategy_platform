Here, the front-label prominence of "Whole Grain" creates the dominant consumer impression, and back-panel disclosures cannot cure front-label deception under established Second Circuit precedent. The reasonable consumer shops based on front-label representations.',

    oppositionResponse: 'Your Honor, requiring specific reliance and price premium allegations would improperly heighten pleading standards beyond Iqbal/Twombly. The deceptive labeling itself constitutes injury under NY GBL ยง349, and economic injury can be presumed from the deceptive practice.',

Defendant cites no case law supporting preemption for general food labeling, and Orlander involved specific federal certification programs not present here.',
    judgeResponse: 'The preemption argument is interesting, but I\'m not seeing a direct conflict between federal and state law here.
