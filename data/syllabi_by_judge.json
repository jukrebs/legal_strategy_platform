        "This is an appeal by Debo's Bail Bond Company, LLC, (\"Debo's\") of an order issued by the Circuit Court for Rutherford County denying Debo's Petition for Relief from Bond.

Following our review, we affirm the denial of the petition.",

With regard to the petition for writ of error coram nobis, the Petitioner argues that the coram nobis court erred in summarily dismissing his petition and that he is entitled to due process tolling of the statute of limitations.

        "The Defendants, Glenn Brown and Thomas Byrd, were jointly tried before a Knox County Criminal Court jury on a number of drug and gun-related offenses. At the conclusion of the trial, both Defendants were convicted of possession with the intent to sell/deliver 0.5 grams or more of cocaine within 1000 feet of a school, possession with the intent to sell/deliver a controlled substance analogue, and possession of marijuana. Defendant Brown was alone convicted of the various gun-related charges, including employment of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony having been previously convicted of a felony. In this consolidated appeal, Defendant Byrd challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in support of his felony convictions and argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his failure to contest the forfeiture of the large amount of cash seized from him. Defendant Brown challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in support of his felony drug and employment of a firearm during a dangerous felony convictions and argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the results of the traffic stop and in issuing inconsistent oral and written jury instructions that prevented unanimity of the verdicts. Following our review, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.",

The second degree murder conviction was merged into the first degree murder conviction, for which the Defendant received a life sentence.

On appeal, the Defendant argues that: (1) the trial court erred in allowing a State's witness to testify concerning statements and text messages made by an unavailable witness (2) the State committed prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument (3) the trial court's instruction that two individuals were accomplices as a matter of law amounted to a comment on the proof and (4) the evidence is insufficient to sustain his convictions. After review, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.",
        "The Defendant, John Calvin Murray, appeals the trial court's dismissal of his \"Motion for Rule 36 Clerical Mistakes\" and denial of his motion to reconsider, which he argues should be liberally construed as a motion to correct an illegal sentence, asserting that he was not awarded all the credits for time served in the community corrections program to which he was entitled. Upon reviewing the record and applicable law, we dismiss the appeal.",

On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred by misclassifying him as a career offender for the Class D and E felonies, by imposing an excessive sentence, and by ordering a sentence of confinement rather than probation or other alternative sentencing.

        "The Defendant, Thomas Byrd, was convicted by a Knox County Criminal Court jury of two counts of possession of .5 grams or more of a Schedule II controlled substance (cocaine) with the intent to sell/deliver within 1000 feet of a child care agency, a Class B felony possession of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony, a Class D felony possession of a Schedule VI controlled substance (marijuana), possession of a Schedule IV controlled substance (Alprazolam), and possession of a Schedule II controlled substance (oxycodone), all Class A misdemeanors and criminal impersonation, a Class B misdemeanor.

        "The Petitioner, Jarod Marges Phillips, appeals the dismissal of his motion to reopen his petition for post-conviction relief. He argues that the post-conviction court erred in summarily dismissing his petition because his claim was based on a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court that established a new rule of constitutional law. Because the Petitioner failed to comply with the statutory requirements for seeking review of a dismissal of a motion to reopen a post-conviction petition, we dismiss the appeal.",

        "The Defendant, Johnvya T. Smith, appeals from the trial court's judgment granting him partial relief based on his 36.1 motion to correct an illegal sentence, arguing that the trial court should have allowed him to withdraw the guilty plea that resulted in the illegal sentence rather than merely amending the sentence. The State disagrees, arguing that the trial court appropriately denied the Defendant's request to withdraw his guilty plea because the illegal aspect of his sentence was not a material component of the Defendant's plea agreement. We agree with the State. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.",
        "The Petitioner, James Andrew Weidekamp, appeals the summary denial of his petition for post-conviction relief, asserting that due process considerations should toll the statute of limitations. After review, we affirm the denial of the petition as time-barred.",

On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred by admitting the video recordings of the victim's forensic interviews, in not conducting a jury out hearing to determine the victim's qualifications as a witness, and by suggesting to the prosecutor the manner in which a question could be posed in order to avoid the Defendant's hearsay objection. Following our review, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.",

Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970). The trial court imposed an effective sentence of 15 years and ordered the Defendant to pay $10,750 in restitution. On appeal, the Defendant argues that the trial court should have held a hearing regarding his ability to pay restitution and the reasonableness of the restitution amount. After review, we reverse the judgment of the trial court with respect to restitution and remand this case for a restitution hearing and entry of amended judgments that reflect the amount of restitution and the manner of payment.",

The trial court sentenced him to 11 months and 29 days in a workhouse, which the court suspended to 11 months and 29 days on supervised probation.

Wallace, was convicted in the Shelby County Criminal Court in case number 95-03054 of first degree felony murder and in case number 95-03055 of attempted first degree murder and was sentenced to consecutive terms of life and fifteen years. The judgment forms reflected over 1,000 days of jail credit awarded in each case. In April 2019, apparently in response to a declaratory judgment action filed by the Defendant against the Department of Correction in the Davidson County Chancery Court, pretrial jail credits that were erroneously included in case number 95-03055 were presumably deleted from the judgment form by notation on the original judgment. The pro se Defendant is now attempting to appeal to this court the trial court's alleged correction of the judgment in case number 95-03055 to remove the erroneously applied jail credits. In the meantime, the Defendant has an appeal of the decision of the Davidson County Chancery Court in his declaratory judgment action pending before the Court of Appeals. Because the record in this case is wholly inadequate for this court to determine what, if anything occurred in the criminal court, and the Defendant appears to have an appeal pending concerning the same matter in the Court of Appeals, we dismiss this appeal.",

On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in support of his child rape and incest convictions, arguing that the State failed to prove that the alleged offenses occurred during the time frame set out in the indictment and that there was insufficient proof of penetration of either victim. Following our review, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.",

        "The Defendant, Jason Doty, was indicted by the Shelby County Grand Jury in count one for aggravated child abuse and in count two for \"aggravated child neglect or endangerment\" based on injuries that occurred to his three-month-old son. Following a jury trial, the Defendant was convicted of the lesser offense of reckless aggravated assault, a Class D felony, in count one and the indicted offense of \"aggravated child neglect or endangerment,\" a Class A felony, in count two. After merging the reckless aggravated assault conviction into the aggravated child neglect or endangerment conviction, the trial court sentenced the Defendant as a Range I, standard offender to twenty-five years at 85 percent in the Department of Correction. The Defendant raises the following five issues on appeal: (1) Whether the trial court issued incomplete and misleading jury instructions that violated his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict (2) Whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain his conviction (3) Whether the trial court erred by not allowing the Defendant to cross-examine the State's child abuse medical expert about a prior dependency and neglect case involving the victim in which a juvenile court magistrate had found the expert's opinion less credible than the opinion of the opposing expert witness (4) Whether the jury's verdicts finding the Defendant guilty of both reckless aggravated assault and aggravated child neglect are mutually exclusive and (5) Whether the trial court imposed an excessive sentence.

As a condition of his plea, the Defendant expressly preserved two certified questions of law pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(A) of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure, stemming from his denied motion to suppress. After thorough review, we conclude that the certified questions do not meet the requirements of Rule 37(b)(2)(A) and State v.

The Defendant also requests that we remand to the trial court for entry of a modified judgment in case number 22CC-2010-CR-115 to award to the Defendant applicable jail credits.

Following our review, we reverse the probation revocation orders in case numbers CR7357 and CR7358A, affirm the revocation of probation in case number 22CC-2010-CR-115, and remand to the trial court for determination of the appropriate jail credits to be applied toward the Defendant's sentence in the latter case.",

On appeal, the Defendant raises three issues for our review: (1)whether the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his confession because itwas not voluntary; (2) whether the State introduced sufficient evidence to corroborate hisconfession for counts three through five under the modified trustworthiness standardoutlined in State v.

Code Ann. \u00a7 39-17-425 (a)(1)-(2).

On appeal, the Defendant argues the trial court committed reversible error (1) in allowing the prosecutor to cross-examine him about his inflammatory rap lyrics and videos and (2) in its jury instructions. After review, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of the Defendant's rap lyrics/videos and that this error was not harmless. We also conclude that the trial court erred in failing to instruct on \"first aggressor proof\" in conjunction with the self-defense instruction and that this error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we reverse the Defendant's conviction for second-degree murder and remand this case to the trial court for a new trial.",

Bishop, 431 S.W.3d 22 (Tenn. 2014), and (2) because his post-polygraph video recorded statement was obtained by law enforcement through coercive interrogation techniques including an express promise of leniency. The Defendant also argues the trial court abused its discretion in failing to exclude as hearsay utterances by the victim's three-year-old brother, \"Joe dead, Joe dead, Joe dead,\" and the response of his aunt, \"Yes baby, Joe dead;\" and in failing to exclude as not relevant and unfairly prejudicial Facebook messages his wife exchanged with a paramour leading up to the victim's death.

        "For the reasons that follow, I am compelled to dissent from the section of the majority opinion affirming the decision of the trial court to deny severance of the offenses in this case. I agree that the trial court correctly determined that permissible joinder, pursuant to Rule 8(b)(2), was proper because of the similar nature of the crimes alleged in this case. In these circumstances, a defendant has an absolute right under Rule 14(b)(1) to have offenses separately tried unless the prosecution shows (1) that the offenses are part of a common scheme or plan, and (2) evidence of each crime would be admissible in the trial of the others. State v. Garrett, 331 S.W.3d 392, 401 (Tenn. 2011) State v. Toliver, 117 S.W.3d 216, 228 (Tenn. 2003) see also State v. Moore, 6 S.W.3d 235, 239 n. 7 (Tenn. 1999) (\"[A] common scheme or plan for severance purposes is the same as a common scheme or plan for evidentiary purposes.\"). To justify consolidation here, the State relied upon the second category of common scheme or plan evidence, that each of the offenses committed and to be joined were part of a larger, continuing plan or conspiracy. State v. Garrett, 331 S.W.3d at 404 (observing that there are three types of common scheme or plan evidence: (1) offenses that reveal a distinctive design or are so similar as to constitute signature crimes (2) offenses that are part of a larger, continuing plan or conspiracy and (3) offenses that are all part of the same criminal transaction) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Because there was no proof that the offenses were part of a larger, continuing plan, I would have concluded that the trial court erred in denying the severance request under Rule 14(b)(1).

The trial court imposed concurrent sentences of 12 years for each of the firearm convictions, 11 months and 29 days for the evading arrest conviction, and 6 months for each driving on a suspended license conviction, for a total effective sentence of 12 years to be served in the Tennessee Department of Correction. On appeal, the Defendant contends that (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress \"the stop and subsequent seizure of [the Defendant]'s vehicle[,]\" and (2) the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Following our review, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.",

Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 39-14-103 39-14-105(a)(3). During a consolidated sentencing hearing on the Defendant's convictions from three separate trials, the trial court sentenced the Defendant as a career offender to 12 years' incarceration, to be served consecutively to the sentences from his other two convictions. On appeal, the Defendant contends that 1) the evidence was insufficient to establish the value of the stolen property and 2) the trial court erred in denying the Defendant's motion of acquittal, or in the alternative, erred in denying his motion for new trial. After careful review, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.",

Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-210(a)(1). The Petitioner subsequently filed a petition for post-conviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. After a hearing, the post-conviction court denied the petition. On appeal, the Petitioner argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, rendering him unable to make a \"knowing and informed\" guilty plea. Specifically, he asserts that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate the case adequately, failing to provide discovery to the Petitioner, and failing to apprise the Petitioner of all the consequences of his guilty plea. After careful review, we affirm the judgment of the postconviction court.",

On appeal, the Defendant challenges the length of the sentences imposed by the trial court. After review, we remand the case for entry of corrected judgment forms as specified in this opinion. In all other respects, the judgments of the trial court are affirmed."

        "This case originates in a dispute over the administration of two trusts created for Joseph Peter Meersman, Jr. (\"Meersman\"). Meersman has filed multiple lawsuits against former trustees Michael Castellarin (\"Castellarin\") and Regions Bank (\"Regions\") (\"Defendants,\" collectively) alleging that they mismanaged the trusts. The trusts were terminated by court order in 2015. Laila Rumsey (\"Rumsey\"), Meersman's partner, sued Defendants in the Chancery Court for Davidson County (\"the Trial Court\") alleging that she too was damaged by Defendants' actions. Defendants filed motions to dismiss, which the Trial Court granted based on the statute of limitations. Rumsey filed a motion to alter or amend within thirty days of entry of judgment but, contrary to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 59.04, did not serve Defendants within thirty days. The Trial Court denied Rumsey's motion as untimely. Rumsey appeals. Rule 59.04 requires such a motion be both \"filed and served\" within thirty days of entry of judgment. Rumsey failed to serve Defendants timely. Therefore, Rumsey's motion to alter or amend was untimely and did not toll the time in which to file a notice of appeal. We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.",

In March 2024, Plaintiffs filed a complaint for fraudulent breach of contract against the Bank; the late Devan D. Ard, Jr., the former Bank president; Rick Belote, Senior Vice President of the Bank; and William Ronald DeBerry (collectively, \"Defendants\"). Defendants filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 11.03. The Chancery Court for Williamson County (\"the Trial Court\") granted the motion, dismissed Plaintiffs' complaint with prejudice, awarded Defendants attorney's fees and expenses incurred in filing the motion, and imposed a screening mechanism on any future filings by Plaintiffs.

        "This appeal concerns Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8, Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5(e), an ethics rule requiring that a division of fees between lawyers who are not in the same firm be agreed to by the client in writing. Trinity Clark (\"Clark\") entered into a retainer agreement with attorney Troy Jones (\"Jones\") on a 1/3 contingency fee. Jones brought Clark's matter to attorney Lance Baker (\"Baker\"), who was not in a firm with Jones. Clark later entered an agreement with Baker on a 45% contingency fee. The Clark-Baker agreement provided, in writing, that Baker could associate other attorneys on the case, but that Clark's overall fee obligation would not increase. The agreement neither identified any other attorneys nor specified how fees would be divided between them. After Clark's case settled, Clark sued Baker in the Circuit Court for Knox County (\"the Trial Court\"), alleging Baker's fee was unreasonable. Jones joined the lawsuit, arguing he was entitled to a share of the fees (\"Plaintiffs,\" Jones and Clark collectively). Baker filed a motion for summary judgment. The Trial Court denied Baker's motion, finding that both the Clark-Jones agreement and the Clark-Baker agreement were invalid for noncompliance with Rule 1.5(e). This interlocutory appeal followed. We find the Clark-Jones agreement invalid. However, with respect to the Clark-Baker agreement, we find that the entire arrangement and Clark's assent thereto satisfied Rule 1.5(e). We reverse on this issue and find that the Clark-Baker agreement is not invalid for failure of compliance with Rule 1.5(e). We affirm, in part, and reverse, in part.",

John Olderman (\"Olderman\") and Christopher Smith (\"Smith\") are manager members of CCD Oldsmith Henry, LLC, and Oldsmith Group, LLC (\"Oldsmith,\" collectively). Oldsmith asked the Town of Nolensville (\"the Town\") to rezone certain property so it could develop residential units on the property. This development would increase traffic at a nearby intersection. At a hearing before the Nolensville Board of Mayor and Aldermen (\"the BOMA\"), Smith said that Oldsmith could help pay to improve the intersection. The Town subsequently rezoned the property. Oldsmith later declined to pay what the Town said it owed, asserting it never agreed to pay so much. In response, the Town refused to issue building permits. Oldsmith sued the Town in the Circuit Court for Williamson County (\"the Trial Court\"). The Town filed a counterclaim and a motion to join Smith and Olderman. The Town alleged that Smith and Olderman fraudulently and negligently misrepresented what Oldsmith was willing to pay. The Trial Court denied the motion, ruling that the Town could obtain complete relief without Smith and Olderman. The Trial Court also ruled that Smith and Olderman could not be held individually liable based on these allegations. The Town appeals. We hold that the Town alleged nothing actionable against Olderman; that the Town sufficiently alleged promissory fraud against Smith; that Smith's status as manager member of an LLC does not insulate him from liability for his own acts or omissions; and that the Trial Court's denial of joinder as to Smith was an abuse of discretion. We affirm the denial of joinder as to Olderman. Otherwise, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.",

Mother exercised most of the parenting time under the original plan. Following a hearing, the Trial Court found that Father had proven a material change in circumstances and that the residential parenting schedule should be modified. Mother remained primary residential parent, but Father was granted equal parenting time. Mother appeals, raising various issues implicating the Trial Court's discretion. We find no reversible error.

The Board said that, going forward, Whisnant should complete his programming as recommended by his Strong R Assessment, namely by continuing his positive behavior, remaining drug free, and taking a few minutes each day for positive reflection. Whisnant filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the Chancery Court for Davidson County (\"the Trial Court\"). The Trial Court upheld the Board's decision. Whisnant appeals. According to Whisnant, the Board violated Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-503(b)(2)(B) by failing to state in writing how he could improve his chances of being released on parole. Whisnant argues that his recommended tasks were open-ended and impossible to complete. We find, as did the Trial Court, that the tasks given to Whisnant clearly were meant to be complied with up to his next parole hearing, at which time the Board can consider Whisnant's compliance or non-compliance as part of its decision-making. The recommended tasks are neither open-ended nor impossible to complete. We hold that the Board complied with Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-503(b)(2)(B). We affirm.",

The Trial Court struck Defendants' defenses and denials in their answer given their failure to provide an accounting of the Trust's assets despite the Trial Court's orders to do so. After a hearing on damages, the Trial Court awarded Daughter half of the asset that was supposed to have been put in the Trust, half of the funds that Son had converted from Father's accounts, attorney's fees, punitive damages, and lost wages.

The Juvenile Court terminated Mother's and Father's parental rights on the ground of severe child abuse. Mother and Father appeal. We find, as did the Juvenile Court, that the ground of severe child abuse was proven against Mother and Father by clear and convincing evidence. We find further, as did the Juvenile Court, that clear and convincing evidence supports termination of Mother's and Father's parental rights as being in the best interest of the Children. We affirm.",

Defendant lives out of state. Plaintiff attempted to serve Defendant via the Tennessee Secretary of State. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss asserting insufficient service of process. The attempted service on Defendant occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the signature requirement for return receipt mail was suspended by the postal service. The signature space on the proof of delivery shows \"E Harvey\" handwritten with \"MRC1C19\" underneath. Plaintiff does not argue that this represents Defendant's signature.

Robert Bates and Laurel Diane Bates (\"Mr. Bates\" and \"Ms. Bates,\" \"Plaintiffs\" collectively) sued the City of Chattanooga, Individually and d/b/a the Brainerd Golf Course (\"Defendant\") in the Circuit Court for Hamilton County (\"the Trial Court\"), alleging personal injuries, loss of services, and loss of consortium stemming from Mr. Bates' fall on Defendant's golf course. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment relying on the Tennessee Recreational Use Statute (\"the TRUS\"), Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 70-7-101, et seq., which provides immunity to landowners who open their property to recreational use. The Trial Court held that Defendant, the landowner, was immune under the TRUS because Mr. Bates was on Defendant's property to play golf, and golf is comparable to the non-exclusive list of recreational activities found at Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 70-7-102. No exception to the TRUS was found to apply. Plaintiffs appeal, arguing that golf is not an activity like those listed at Section 102 of the TRUS. Plaintiffs argue further that the fact Mr. Bates paid to play on Defendant's golf course means Defendant is not entitled to immunity. We hold, inter alia, that golf is sufficiently comparable to Section 102 enumerated activities, particularly hiking, sightseeing, and target shooting, such that Defendant is entitled to immunity under the TRUS. In addition, the fact that Mr. Bates paid to play on Defendant's golf course is not dispositive because the TRUS has no applicable consideration exception. We affirm.",

The building burned down during Buckeye's tenancy. Buckeye filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it was impossible to obtain fire insurance coverage for only a portion of the building as required by the lease. The Trial Court granted Buckeye's motion. Dr. Coffey appealed. Upon our review, we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact and reverse the Trial Court's order dismissing Dr. Coffey's complaint.",

After a hearing, the Juvenile Court entered an order terminating Mother's and Father's parental rights.

Mother appeals.1 On appeal, Mother argues that the Juvenile Court did not make sufficient best interest findings and, even if it did, it erred in its analysis. We vacate the ground of substantial noncompliance with the permanency plan as the record contains only Mother's third plan. Thus, we modify the Juvenile Court's judgment to that extent. Otherwise, we find that each of the other grounds found by the Juvenile Court was proven by clear and convincing evidence.

After a hearing, the Trial Court entered an order terminating Father's parental rights on five grounds, including severe child abuse. Father appeals, arguing among other things that he did not intentionally or knowingly harm Bentley. We vacate the Trial Court's waiver of a home study of Bentley in Petitioners' home because Tenn.

Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 12.02(6), claiming that the accrual of Plaintiff's cause of action arose no later than June 21, 2020, meaning Plaintiff provided pre-suit notice past the one-year statute of limitations, rendering his complaint untimely. Defendants also argued that Plaintiff failed to comply with the pre-suit notice requirements of Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 29-26-121(a).

Contrary to Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 27 and Rule 6 of the Tennessee Court of Appeals, Plaintiff's brief fails to cite the record.

We hold, inter alia, that Plaintiffs are bound by the agreement announced in court whereby the parties waived their right to appeal. We hold further that the law of the case doctrine prevents Plaintiffs from relitigating the distribution of Dr. Key's estate. We affirm. Defendants' motions to dismiss are denied as moot. We find this appeal frivolous, and remand for the Trial Court to award Defendants reasonable attorney's fees and expenses under Tenn.

        "This appeal involves an award of attorney's fees pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 20-12-119(c). The trial court dismissed two of the plaintiff's three claims for relief pled in his amended complaint pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ.

The third claim also was included in the defendant's motion to dismiss, as well as arguments for improper venue and lack of subject matter jurisdiction, all of which were denied by the trial court. More than thirty days after a final judgment was entered, the defendant requested an award of attorney's fees and discretionary costs. In his supporting affidavit, the defendant's counsel included attorney's fees as relevant to the entire motion to dismiss instead of distinguishing the time spent regarding the claims that were dismissed pursuant to Rule 12.02(6). The trial court awarded the defendant attorney's fees in the amount of $10,000, which is the maximum amount of attorney's fees a trial court can award under Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 20-12-119(c). The trial court denied the defendant's request for discretionary costs as untimely. We affirm the trial court's denial of discretionary costs, vacate the award of attorney's fees, and remand for the Trial Court to reconsider the attorney's fees award as consistent with this opinion and the Tennessee Supreme Court's opinion in Donovan v. Hastings, No. M2019-01396-SC-R11-CV, -- S.W.3d -- , 2022 WL 2301177 (Tenn. June 27, 2022).",
        "This appeal concerns a penalty assessed against a company by the Tennessee Bureau of Workers' Compensation (\"the Bureau\"). The Bureau assessed a penalty against Jase Enterprises, LLC (\"Jase\"), a construction company owned by Jason Usery (\"Usery\"), for failure to secure workers' compensation insurance coverage. After a contested case hearing, the administrative law judge (\"the ALJ\") upheld the penalty assessment but modified its amount. Jase petitioned for judicial review in the Chancery Court for Henderson County (\"the Trial Court\"). The Trial Court upheld the ALJ's decision. Jase appeals to this Court, arguing among other things that it was not afforded due process and that the decision to assess a penalty against it was arbitrary. In particular, Jase argues that the evidence did not establish that Joe Sheldon (\"Sheldon\") was a Jase employee. We find that Jase was afforded due process it received adequate notice and had an opportunity to be heard. We find further that the penalty assessment against Jase was supported by substantial and material evidence, including Sheldon's deposition. We affirm.",
        "This appeal involves a claim of intentional or, alternatively, negligent infliction of emotional distress. Christian Andreacchio, son of Todd and Rae Andreacchio (\"Plaintiffs\"), died in Meridian, Mississippi. The Meridian Police Department ruled Christian Andreacchio's death a suicide. Plaintiffs contend that, contrary to the official conclusion, their son was murdered. Joseph (aka Joel) Hamilton (\"Defendant\") created a Facebook page to express his own opinions on the matter. Defendant has argued publicly in favor of the Meridian Police Department's conclusion. Plaintiffs sued Defendant and John Does 1-100 in the Circuit Court for Dickson County (\"the Trial Court\") for distributing Christian Andreacchio's autopsy photographs online. The photographs were public records released by the Mississippi Attorney General's Office. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, which the Trial Court granted. Plaintiffs appeal. Plaintiffs argue that Defendant exceeded the bounds of constitutionally protected speech by distributing their son's autopsy photographs online. The undisputed material facts show that the information Defendant is alleged to have shared is truthful information, public records, concerning a matter of public significance. We hold, as a matter of law, that Plaintiffs cannot prevail on their claims. We affirm.",
        "This appeal stems from a divorce proceeding, in which the Shelby County Circuit Court (\"Trial Court\") found that two billboard marketing agreements for billboards located at 5871 Poplar Avenue and 0 Ricky Bell Cove were property belonging to the corporation, St. Charles Place, Inc., a corporation owned solely by Husband. The Trial Court found that the parties' marriage was short-term in nature and distributed the marital property, awarding Dawna Divine Boone (\"Wife\") 60% of the marital estate and Charles Price Boone (\"Husband\") 40% of the marital estate. Discerning no reversible error, we affirm the Trial Court in all respects.",
        "This appeal arises from a lawsuit alleging that a number of Presbyterian church entities were negligent regarding the sexual abuse of minors by a Presbyterian clergyman. John Doe 1, John Doe 2, and John Doe 3 (\"Plaintiffs\") , members and/or attendees of Woodland Presbyterian Church (\"Woodland\") in the 1990s, sued former pastor James B. Stanford (\"Stanford\") and a host of Presbyterian institutional defendants for negligence in the Circuit Court for Shelby County (\"the Trial Court\"). The institutional defendants filed motions to dismiss, which were granted by the Trial Court. Plaintiffs appeal arguing, among other things, that the statute of limitations was tolled due to fraudulent concealment. They argue further that the Trial Court erred in dismissing their claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress stemming from certain of the institutional defendants allegedly releasing Plaintiffs' names to the media in 2019. We affirm the Trial Court's dismissal of Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), A Corporation and Evangelical Presbyterian Church for lack of personal jurisdiction. However, we hold further, inter alia, that in view of the Tennessee Supreme Court's holding in Redwing v. Catholic Bishop for the Diocese of Memphis, 363 S.W.3d 436 (Tenn. 2012), the Trial Court erred in dismissing Plaintiffs' complaint at the motion to dismiss stage based upon the statute of limitations when Plaintiffs alleged that efforts were made by certain of the institutional defendants to hide the sexual abuse and a \"whitewash\" ensued. As Plaintiffs successfully alleged fraudulent concealment, we reverse the Trial Court with respect to the statute of limitations issue. We also reverse the Trial Court's dismissal of Plaintiffs' negligent infliction of emotional distress claim against Woodland and Presbytery of the Central South, Inc. We, therefore, affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Trial Court, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.",
        "This appeal concerns a dispute over insurance coverage. Amy Higgs (\"Higgs\") individually and on behalf of her deceased son, Cayson Emmit Turnmire (\"Cayson\"), sued David Payne (\"Payne\") for the negligent maintenance of his property in relation to Cayson's death by drowning in Payne's swimming pool. Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company (\"Tennessee Farmers\"), Payne's homeowners' insurance carrier, filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Shelby County (\"the Trial Court\") against Payne and Higgs. Tennessee Farmers argued that, due to an exclusion in Payne's homeowners' insurance policy against claims \"arising from or in connection with the swimming pool,\" it is not obligated to defend or indemnify Payne. Tennessee Farmers and Higgs filed cross motions for summary judgment. The Trial Court granted Tennessee Farmers' motion and denied Higgs' motion. Higgs appeals. Citing the concurrent cause doctrine, Higgs argues that Tennessee Farmers must defend and indemnify Payne as, apart from the pool, certain non-excluded causes contributed to Cayson's death\u2014namely, Payne's failure to fence or gate his property. We hold, inter alia, that each of Higgs' alleged non-excluded concurrent causes are bound up inextricably with Cayson's tragic drowning in Payne's pool, an excluded cause under Payne's insurance policy. We affirm.",
        "An inmate filed a petition for declaratory judgment against the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Corrections (\"TDOC\"). The action was filed in Wayne County Chancery Court instead of Davidson County Chancery Court as required by Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 4-5-225(a). The trial court found that venue in Wayne County Chancery Court was not proper and that it was not in the interest of justice to transfer venue to Davidson County because Defendant neither had paid any portion of the filing fee, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-21-807,nor had he named the agency, TDOC, as a party to the action as required by Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 4-5-225(a). The trial court, therefore, dismissed the inmate's petition. We find that the inmate had not failed to comply with the partial filing fee payment because the trial court had not assessed the initial filing fee to be paid. However, the trial court was correct that the inmate had failed to include TDOC as a party to the action as required by Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 4-5-225(a). Upon consideration of the appellee's argument concerning the timeliness of the inmate's notice of appeal, we hold that we have subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal. Although we disagree with the trial court's conclusion regarding the inmate's compliance with Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-21-807, we affirm the trial court's judgment dismissing the inmate's action because the inmate failed to name TDOC as a party to the action.",
        "This appeal concerns the termination of a mother's parental rights to her minor children. The Tennessee Department of Children's Services (\"DCS\") filed a petition in the Juvenile Court for Crockett County (\"the Juvenile Court\") seeking to terminate the parental rights of Tiffany T. (\"Mother\") to her minor children, Miranda and Baylee (\"the Children\"). After a hearing, the Juvenile Court entered an order terminating Mother's parental rights on four grounds and finding that termination of Mother's parental rights is in the Children's best interest. Mother appeals, arguing solely that the Juvenile Court erred in its best interest determination. We find, as did the Juvenile Court, that DCS proved four grounds for termination of parental rights against Mother by clear and convincing evidence. We find further by clear and convincing evidence, as did the Juvenile Court, that termination of Mother's parental rights is in the Children's best interest. We affirm the judgment of the Juvenile Court.",
        "This appeal concerns a claim of legal malpractice. Xingkui Guo (\"Plaintiff\") filed a lawsuit for legal malpractice in the Circuit Court for Davidson County (\"the Trial Court\") against his former attorney Jon David Rogers (\"Defendant\"). Defendant filed an answer denying Plaintiff's allegations as well as a counterclaim alleging that Plaintiff failed to pay him in full pursuant to the terms of their agreement. Defendant later filed motions for summary judgment as to both Plaintiff's complaint against him and his counterclaim against Plaintiff. The Trial Court granted Defendant's motions for summary judgment. Plaintiff appeals. We hold, inter alia, that there is no genuine issue of material fact necessitating trial. The undisputed material evidence shows that Plaintiff's loss in the underlying lawsuit was not due to negligence in Defendant's representation. The undisputed material evidence shows further that Plaintiff breached his retainer agreement with Defendant by failing to pay him in full pursuant to the terms of the agreement. We affirm the judgment of the Trial Court.",
        "This appeal involves the calculation of post-judgment interest applying Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 47-14-121. The trial court calculatedpost-judgment interest utilizing the statutory interest rate that was applicable when the judgment was entered without modifying the interest rate when the statutory rate subsequently changed. Discerning no error, we affirm. We also deny the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees on appeal.",
        "This appeal concerns the enforceability of an arbitration agreement in a wrongful death lawsuit. James Williams (\"Plaintiff\"), individually as next of kin and on behalf of the wrongful death beneficiaries of Granville Earl Williams, Jr., deceased (\"Decedent\"), sued Smyrna Residential, LLC d/b/a Azalea Court and Americare Systems, Inc. (\"Defendants,\" collectively) in the Circuit Court for Rutherford County (\"the Trial Court\"). Decedent was a resident of Azalea Court, an assisted living facility. Plaintiff alleged his father died because of Defendants' negligence. Defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration, citing an arbitration agreement (\"the Agreement\") entered into by Decedent's daughter and durable power of attorney Karen Sams (\"Sams\") on behalf of Decedent when the latter was admitted to Azalea Court. Notably, the durable power of attorney (\"the POA\") did not cover healthcare decision-making. The Trial Court held that Sams lacked authority to enter into the Agreement and that, in any event, the wrongful death beneficiaries would not be bound by the Agreement even if it were enforceable. Defendants appeal. We affirm.",
        "This appeal involves a mother's petition seeking to relocate to Canada with the parties' minor child.

        "This appeal concerns the interpretation of a will. Mary Bell McGraw Marlin (\"Decedent\"), a property owner in Rutherford County, left her farm to her surviving children. Decedent's holographic will provided equal acres to each heir, although a survey purporting to show how to divide the land was missing. After years of futile discussions over how to divide the farm, Decedent's grandson Harry Marlin, III filed suit in chancery court seeking to partition the land. The matter was referred to the Probate Court for Rutherford County (\"the Probate Court\"). After a hearing, the Probate Court entered an order dividing the land amongst the heirs. Harry Marlin, III appeals. He argues that the Probate Court erred by dividing the land into equal acres without regard to the economic value of the respective tracts. We hold, inter alia, that Decedent's will controls and it provided for equal acres, not equally valued acres. We further find that the evidence does not preponderate against the Probate Court's determination as to which tract each heir was to receive. We affirm.",
        "This appeal concerns the Open Courts Clause of the Tennessee Constitution. Michael Halliburton (\"Halliburton\"), an inmate, filed a petition for common law writ of certiorari in the Chancery Court for Davidson County (\"the Trial Court\") against the Tennessee Board of Parole (\"the Board\") seeking judicial review of his March 10, 2020 parole proceedings before the Board. The Trial Court dismissed Halliburton's petition. In so doing, the Trial Court relied on Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-21-812, which provides that \"on notice of assessment of any fees, taxes, costs and expenses under this part, a clerk of a court may not accept for filing another claim by the same inmate until prior fees, taxes, costs and other expenses are paid in full.\" This Court affirmed, holding in part that Halliburton waived his issue of whether Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-21-812 violates the Open Courts Clause in Article I, Section 17 of the Tennessee Constitution. However, the Tennessee Supreme Court found that Halliburton sufficiently raised the issue in his answer to the Board's motion to dismiss. Our Supreme Court granted Halliburton's application for permission to appeal, and remanded for this Court to consider his Open Courts issue. We hold, inter alia, that Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-21-812 places a constitutionally permissible limitation on the right of inmates to file civil actions. The statute does not permanently bar inmates from seeking redress it simply requires they pay outstanding fees first. Therefore, we hold that Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-21-812 does not violate the Open Courts Clause. We affirm.",
        "The defendant appeals the trial court's judgment finding that he violated a reckless driving city ordinance, Metropolitan Code of Law \u00a7 12.68.180, when he drove 65 miles per hour in a 45-mile-per-hour zone. During trial, Metropolitan Government of Nashville & Davidson County, Tennessee (\"Metro\") presented evidence regarding the defendant's speed to support its allegation that the defendant was driving recklessly. Following proof of the defendant's excessive speed, the trial court found that the defendant had failed to rebut the presumption created by ordinance that he was driving in such a way as to demonstrate \"a wilful and wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property.\" The defendant challenges the constitutionality of such ordinance, which provides a rebuttable presumption that the defendant was driving recklessly when driving at least fifteen miles per hour over the speed limit. However, the defendant's issues concerning constitutionality of the ordinance were not properly raised or decided by the trial court, and upon our determination that the ordinance is not facially unconstitutional, we hold that the defendant has waived his issues regarding the constitutionality of the ordinance. Upon our review of the record, we affirm the trial court's judgment that the defendant violated Metropolitan Code of Law \u00a7 12.68.180.",
        "This appeal concerns the termination of parental rights.

(\"Father\") and Anna H. (\"Mother\") to their minor child Cora W. (\"the Child\"). After a trial, the Juvenile Court entered an order finding by clear and convincing evidence that the grounds of wanton disregard and severe child abuse were proven against both parents. The Juvenile Court found further, also by clear and convincing evidence, that termination of Mother's and Father's parental rights is in the Child's best interest. Mother and Father appeal. Among other things, both parents argue that their pre-incarceration conduct was not part of a broader pattern sufficient to sustain the ground of wanton disregard. Neither parent disputes the ground of severe child abuse, which was based upon the Child's massive exposure to drugs including methamphetamine. We affirm the Juvenile Court.",
        "This appeal concerns opposition by the City of Cleveland, Tennessee (\"the City\") to an application by Middle Tennessee Treatment Centers, LLC, d/b/a Cleveland Comprehensive Treatment Center (\"CCTC\") to operate a nonresidential, substitution-based treatment center for opiate addiction within the City. The City filed a petition for declaratory judgment in the Chancery Court for Davidson County (\"the Trial Court\") against the Tennessee Health Services and Development Agency (\"the Agency\") seeking to have the certificate of need granted for CCTC revoked on grounds that CCTC failed to provide proof of service upon the City by certified mail, return receipt requested, in contravention of Tenn.

After a hearing, the Trial Court granted Defendants' motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The City appeals. We hold, inter alia, that the purpose of the notice provision in Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-11-1607(c)(9)(A) is to afford the relevant officials an opportunity to participate in an Agency hearing on whether a certificate of need is granted proof of receipt is required.

After a hearing, the Juvenile Court entered an order terminating Mother's parental rights on a number of grounds. Mother appeals. We find, by clear and convincing evidence, that five grounds for termination were proven against Mother and that termination of Mother's parental rights is in the Children's best interest.

        "This appeal concerns a police officer's termination. Kodi Gail Knight (\"Knight\") was a police officer for the City of Fairview, Tennessee (\"Fairview\"). After an August 2019 incident in which Knight struck a handcuffed woman (\"the Arrestee\") in the face, Fairview police chief Zack Humphreys (\"Chief Humphreys\") submitted a request to City Manager Scott Collins (\"the City Manager\") that Knight be terminated. The City Manager sent Knight a termination letter. Knight requested, and was granted, a pre-dismissal hearing before the City Manager. Following this hearing, the City Manager affirmed the decision to terminate Knight. Knight filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the Chancery Court for Williamson County (\"the Trial Court\"). The Trial Court affirmed Fairview's termination of Knight. Knight appeals, arguing among other things that his procedural due process rights were violated because the City Manager both drafted his termination letter and presided over his pre-dismissal hearing. We find that Knight was an at-will employee who lacked a property interest entitling him to procedural due process protection. We also find that the City Manager's decision was supported by substantial and material evidence and was neither arbitrary nor capricious. We affirm the judgment of the Trial Court.",

Guidesoft, Inc. d/b/a Knowledge Services (\"Knowledge Services\"), an unsuccessful bidder, filed a protest with the Central Procurement Office (\"the CPO\"). The CPO dismissed Knowledge Services' bid for insufficient bond. Knowledge Services appealed to the State Protest Committee (\"the Committee\"), which denied the appeal. Knowledge Services then filed a petition for common law writ of certiorari in the Chancery Court for Davidson County (\"the Trial Court\"). After a hearing, the Trial Court dismissed Knowledge Services' amended petition. Knowledge Services now appeals to this Court, arguing that under Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 12-3-514(d), its protest bond should be based on 5% of the lowest evaluated cost proposal rather than 5% of the State's estimated maximum liability as found below. We hold, inter alia, that the protest bond statute is meant to protect the State, and the appropriate protest bond amount is based on the costs the State may incur rather than a bidder's proposed cost. Further, the fee relied upon by Knowledge Services to calculate its protest bond is but a small portion of the contract at issue, which is estimated to cost the State $190,000,000. The Committee did not exceed its jurisdiction or act illegally, arbitrarily, or fraudulently. We affirm the Trial Court.",
        "This appeal arises from a post-divorce proceeding. The father filed a petition to modify child support, and the mother filed a civil contempt action against the father for failure to pay child support as ordered by the court. Following trial, the trial court found that a significant variance existed from the previously ordered child support obligation and granted the father's petition to modify child support. The trial court retroactively modified the father's child support obligation from the date the petition was filed, resulting in three modifications while the petition had been pending. In the respective child support worksheets for the modifications, the trial court declined to include a credit to the mother for the health insurance premiums she had paid for the child, determining such expense of additional insurance coverage not to be \"a reasonable necessity or requirement.\" In consideration of the mother's civil contempt complaint, the trial court found that the father had been in contempt of court due to his failure to pay child support as ordered by the court but that he had cured his contempt due to an involuntary payment from his income tax refund proceeds and the retroactive modification of his obligation and resultant overpayment of child support while the petition to modify was pending. The trial court further denied an award of attorney's fees to either party. Discerning no error, we affirm the trial court in all respects.",

        "This appeal concerns a post-divorce child support matter. Elizabeth Dale Crafton (\"Mother\") sued James Frederick Roberts (\"Father\") for divorce. In 2007, the Circuit Court for Shelby County (\"the Circuit Court\") entered a final decree of divorce in the case. In 2008, the Circuit Court entered a permanent parenting plan concerning the parties' children. The Juvenile Court for Shelby County (\"the Juvenile Court\") later accepted jurisdiction for child support matters. Father went on to file a series of motions seeking to be relieved from paying for private school tuition. In 2019, the Juvenile Court entered an order denying Father relief and resolving all outstanding matters. Father appeals, arguing among other things that the original child support order is void as against public policy for failure to adhere to the Child Support Guidelines, and that the succeeding orders are void, as well. As the original child support order did not entirely relieve the parents of their duty to support and otherwise was jurisdictionally sound, we hold that it is not void. We affirm.",

As part of a permanent parenting plan, both parents were to insure their respective lives for $300,000 until the child support obligation was completed, with the children named as the sole beneficiaries to the policies and the other parent named as trustee for the benefit of the children. The Trial Court granted summary judgment finding that the children had a vested interest in the life insurance policy but that they were only entitled to the portion of the proceeds equivalent to the remaining child support obligation. With the defendant's concession on appeal that the children had a vested interest in the life insurance proceeds, that a constructive trust was appropriate, and that the most recent permanent parenting plan was controlling, the only issues before this Court involved the amount of life insurance proceeds to which the children were entitled and attorney's fees. We modify the amount of the Trial Court's judgment and hold that the children are entitled to the entire $300,000 life insurance proceeds per the agreed permanent parenting plan. We affirm the Trial Court's denial of attorney's fees. Additionally, we deny the mother's request for an award of attorney's fees incurred on appeal.",

P. 60.02 asserting that the order was not stamped to be mailed until six days after it was filed and it went to a PO Box Plaintiffs' counsel does not use for business. The Trial Court granted the motion and entered a new order of dismissal, from which Mr. Mack appeals. We find that Mr. Mack failed to meet the clear and convincing evidentiary burden necessary for Rule 60.02 relief indeed, the Trial Court relied only upon statements of counsel rather than evidence.

        "This appeal concerns a disposition in a dependency and neglect case. Leslie S. (\"Mother\") is the mother of the subject minor children Isabella S., Macie S., and Gabriel S. (\"the Children,\" collectively). The Children's maternal grandparents Sheila W. and Richard W. (\"Grandparents\") filed a petition for dependency and neglect in the Juvenile Court for Williamson County (\"the Juvenile Court\"). The Juvenile Court adjudicated the Children dependent and neglected. In the disposition phase, the Juvenile Court awarded Grandparents permanent guardianship of the Children, with Mother to exercise only supervised visitation. Mother appealed to the Circuit Court for Williamson County (\"the Circuit Court\"), which reached the same result. Mother now appeals to this Court, arguing that the Children should be returned to her custody or, alternatively, that her visits be unsupervised. The Circuit Court found, among other things, that Mother's fianc\u00e9 Allen M.

In one issue, Wife argues that the Trial Court placed inordinate weight on the fact that Husband is 16 years older than her in awarding him roughly 59% of the marital estate, even though his earning power is substantially greater than hers. We agree. We vacate the Trial Court's division of the marital estate and remand for a new and equitable division that is as close to a 50/50 division as possible, based upon the specific facts of this case. However, on all other issues, we discern no reversible error by the Trial Court.

Following the respondents' motion to dismiss pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 12.02(1) and (6) and Petitioner's response thereto, the Trial Court dismissed Petitioners' original civil rights cause of action, filed pursuant to section 1983, due to its impermissible joinder with an appellate cause of action. The Trial Court further granted the motion to dismiss as to the writ of certiorari, in part, because Petitioner had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Because Petitioner has failed to comply with Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 27 by not presenting an argument concerning whether he had exhausted his administrative remedies prior to filing his petition for writ of certiorari, he has waived this issue on appeal. As such, the Trial Court's dismissal of the petition is affirmed. Petitioner also raises an issue concerning the amount of filing fees he was required to pay by the Trial Court to initiate the current action. On remand, the Trial Court shall revisit its order regarding the amount of filing fees to determine compliance with Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 8-21-401.",
        "This appeal involves the termination of a father's parental rights. The Trial Court conducted a trial and entered an order finding that the statutory ground of abandonment existed for termination of the father's parental rights and that termination was in the child's best interest. Because a court reporter was not present, the Trial Court approved a statement of the evidence for purposes of appeal. We determine that the Trial Court failed to make sufficient findings of fact relevant to the statutory grounds of abandonment by failure to visit the child and failure to provide financial support for the child that were in effect at the time of the 2017 termination petition, as required by Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 36-1-113(k), and that the statement of the evidence approved by the Trial Court is insufficient for us to review the termination on appeal. Therefore, we vacate the Trial Court's judgment terminating the father's parental rights. We remand for the Trial Court to enter an order with sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law on each of the statutory grounds for the termination of the father's parental rights and the best interest analysis. If there is a subsequent appeal of that order, the Trial Court shall develop a more detailed statement of the evidence reflecting a complete account of the testimony and evidence presented during trial. If a detailed statement of the evidence is not possible, the Trial Court shall conduct additional proceedings as necessary to prepare a sufficient record for appeal, including a new trial if necessary.",

(\"Father\") and Annalisa P. (\"Mother\") to their minor child, Ryan J. H. (\"the Child\"). After a hearing, the Juvenile Court entered an order terminating Father and Mother's parental rights on a host of grounds and finding that termination of Father and Mother's parental rights is in the Child's best interest. Father and Mother appeal. We reverse several grounds rightly conceded on appeal by DCS. We affirm the grounds of failure to support as to Father and substantial noncompliance with the permanency plan as to both Father and Mother. In addition, we reverse the Juvenile Court's finding that DCS failed to prove the ground of failure to manifest an ability and willingness to assume custody, and instead find that ground proven as to both Father and Mother by clear and convincing evidence. We find further that termination of Father and Mother's parental rights is in the Child's best interest. Thus, while we reverse the Juvenile Court's judgment in part, we affirm its termination of Father and Mother's parental rights to the Child.",

        "This appeal concerns a noncompetition agreement. The Total Garage Store, LLC (\"TGS\") sued former employee Nicholas C. Moody (\"Moody\") in the Chancery Court for Montgomery County (\"the Trial Court\"). TGS alleged that Moody violated his noncompetition agreement (\"the Agreement\"). At the end of a hearing on TGS's motion for a temporary injunction held 35 days after suit was filed, the Trial Court invoked Tenn. R. Civ. P. 65.04(7) to declare that the hearing was on the merits of the case, not just the injunction. The Trial Court found the Agreement enforceable and entered an injunction order. Later, TGS filed a motion for contempt against Moody alleging that he violated the order. After a hearing, the Trial Court found Moody guilty of six counts of criminal contempt. The Trial Court also awarded damages to TGS. Moody appeals. Because the record does not reflect that Moody received adequate notice that the injunction hearing also would be on the merits, we vacate the Trial Court's judgment as it pertains to Moody's alleged violation of the Agreement. However, this does not and did not entitle Moody to ignore the temporary injunction, and we affirm the Trial Court in its finding Moody guilty of criminal contempt. We therefore affirm, in part, and vacate, in part, the Trial Court's judgment, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.",

Wife later filed a motion pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02 seeking to have the MDA and Final Decree of Divorce set aside on grounds of mistake of fact, fraud, and fundamental unfairness. After a hearing at which both Husband and Wife testified, the Trial Court denied Wife's motion. Wife appeals, arguing among other things that she was coerced into signing the MDA. Deferring to the Trial Court's implicit credibility determinations, we do not find that Wife was coerced into signing the MDA. Wife failed to meet her burden of clear and convincing evidence that there was mistake of fact, fraud, or fundamental unfairness in the execution of the MDA. In sum, we discern no abuse of discretion in the Trial Court's decision to deny Wife's Rule 60.02 motion. We affirm.",

The Trial Court entered an order denying the petition to probate the will, finding that the markings on the will \"negated it from being accepted to Probate\" and that the decedent had, therefore, died intestate.

        "This suit was brought under the Tennessee Human Rights Act by two African-American employees against their employer and their union to recover for alleged discrimination that created a hostile work environment. At issue in this appeal is the grant of summary judgment to the union on the basis that it did not cause or attempt to cause the employer to discriminate. Upon our de novo review, we conclude that the evidence presented at the summary judgment stage negated an essential element of the Plaintiffs' claim and thus summary judgment was warranted. Judgment affirmed.",

The Tennessee Department of Children's Services (\"DCS\") filed a petition in the Juvenile Court for Macon County (\"the Juvenile Court\") seeking to terminate the parental rights of James H.

After a trial, the Juvenile Court entered an order terminating Father's parental rights on the grounds of wanton disregard, severe child abuse, and failure to manifest an ability and willingness to assume custody. The Juvenile Court found also that termination of Father's parental rights is in the Child's best interest. Father appeals. With respect to wanton disregard, the Juvenile Court found only that Father committed criminal acts resulting in his incarceration, which by itself is insufficient to establish the ground. We, therefore, vacate the ground of wanton disregard. However, we find that the other two grounds were proven by clear and convincing evidence and, by the same standard, that termination of Father's parental rights is in the Child's best interest. We vacate, in part, and affirm, as modified.",

Upon petition of the Tennessee Department of Children's Services (\"DCS\"), the Trial Court terminated Mother's parental rights to the Children upon the statutory grounds of abandonment by failure to visit prior to her incarceration, abandonment by wanton disregard, abandonment by failure to provide a suitable home, substantial noncompliance with the permanency plans, persistent conditions, and failure to manifest an ability and willingness to assume custody or financial responsibility of the Children. The Trial Court further found that termination of Mother's parental rights was in the Children's best interest. Mother timely appealed.

        "There is a difference between a claim asserting a law is facially unconstitutional and a claim asserting an unconstitutional facial taking occurred. An ordinary facial challenge requires a plaintiff to prove the legislature exceeded a constitutional limitation when it enacted a law, and consequently the law on its face violates the constitution. A facial taking claim, on the other hand, is a specific type of facial challenge that asserts the mere enactment of a statute constitutes a taking. Whether a claim is a facial or as-applied challenge is not of great import when deciding whether it has accrued for purposes of a statute of limitation. The accrual date of a facial or as- applied challenge is identical to the accrual date of other substantive claims\u2014the date upon which the plaintiff's injury occurred and the cause of action became complete. A case alleging facial unconstitutionality is ripe not simply when the law is passed but, just like an asapplied challenge, when the government acts pursuant to that law and adversely affects the plaintiff's rights. Regulatory takings are different than physical takings. An important distinction between physical and regulatory takings claims is the accrual date. In a regulatory taking, it is passage of the ordinance that injures a property's value or usefulness. But a physical taking causes injury when the property itself is taken.",

        "The Petitioner, Rodney Turner, appeals the post-conviction court's denial of his postconviction petition, in which he challenged his two convictions of attempted first degree murder and one conviction of employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony and the resulting total effective sentence of fifty years. On appeal, the Petitioner contends that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on direct appeal and that the post-conviction court erred by denying funds for a fingerprint expert. Upon reviewing the record, the parties' briefs, oral arguments, and the applicable law, we affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.",
        "The Defendant, John P. Stone, was convicted of aggravated burglary following a bench trial, and he received a sentence of twelve years in confinement. On appeal, the Defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of aggravated burglary. After reviewing the record, the parties' briefs, and the applicable law, we affirm the trial court's judgment.",
        "The Petitioner, DeShawn McClenton, appeals the summary dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas corpus. After review, we affirm the judgment of the habeas corpus court.",
        "A jury convicted the Defendant, Bobby Lovin, of two counts of rape of a child, and he received an effective sixty-four-year sentence. The Defendant appeals, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence on one count of rape of a child and the trial court's admission of the victim's recorded forensic interview. We conclude that the evidence is sufficient and that there was no error in the admission of the video, and we affirm the trial court's judgments.",
        "The Defendant, Marvin Dewayne Bullock, appeals his convictions for four counts of rape of a child, five counts of rape, nine counts of incest, three counts of sexual battery by an authority figure, one count of solicitation of sexual exploitation of a minor, two counts of sexual exploitation of a minor, and one count of aggravated sexual battery, for which he received an effective sentence of 178 years. On appeal, the Defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions that due to a hearing impairment, he was unable to hear the witnesses' testimony at trial that the prosecutor improperly coached jurors during voir dire in how to avoid jury service that his sentences are excessive and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. We conclude that the Defendant's notice of appeal was untimely and that the untimely filing should not be waived in the interest of justice. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal, and we remand the case to the trial court for entry of corrected judgments as set forth in the opinion.",
        "The Petitioner, Donte Green, appeals the denial of his petition for post-conviction relief from his convictions relating to the possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia resulting from law enforcement's seizure of illegal substances from the Petitioner's motel room pursuant to a search warrant. He claims that appellate counsel was ineffective due to her failure to challenge the validity of the search warrant on direct appeal. See State v. Donte Lavon Green, No. W2018-00092-CCA-R3-CD, 2019 WL 1595684 (Tenn. Crim. App. Apr. 15, 2019), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Aug. 16, 2019). He also claims that his convictions are voidable due to the abridgement of his Fourth Amendment rights and article I, section 7 of the Tennessee Constitution because the search conducted by law enforcement was illegal and that the evidence seized should have been suppressed as a result. After review, we affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.",
        "A jury convicted the Defendant, Corey Young, of possession of three hundred grams or more of methamphetamine with the intent to sell in a school zone, a Class A felony possession of three hundred grams or more of methamphetamine with the intent to deliver in a school zone, a Class A felony two counts of possession of a firearm with the intent to go armed during the commission of or attempt to commit a dangerous felony, a Class D felony and two counts of possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony drug offense, a Class C felony. He received an effective sentence of forty-one years. On appeal, the Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and asserts that his right to confront witnesses was violated. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm the Defendant's convictions and remand for correction of the judgment forms.",
        "The Defendant, Jerry Louis Fitzgerald, Jr., was convicted at trial of sexual battery and possession of 0.5 grams or more of cocaine with the intent to sell or deliver, and he received an effective sentence of fourteen years in confinement. On appeal, the Defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of sexual battery and that although he possessed the cocaine, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he intended to sell or deliver it. After review, we affirm the trial court's judgments.",
        "The Defendant, Patricia Kaye Wilkey, appeals her conviction of first degree premeditated murder, for which she received a sentence of life imprisonment. On appeal, the Defendant asserts that (1) the evidence is insufficient to support her conviction (2) the trial court improperly limited defense counsel's cross-examination of the State's witnesses (3) the trial court erred in admitting hearsay statements (4) the State made improper comments during closing arguments and (5) the trial court imposed an excessive sentence. Upon reviewing the record, the parties' briefs and oral arguments, and the applicable law, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.",
        "The Defendant, Robert Daniel Owens, Jr., pleaded guilty to one count each of aggravated burglary, domestic assault, assault, and aggravated stalking, and he received an effective sentence of four years on supervised probation after service of eleven months, twenty-nine days in confinement, followed by a consecutive sentence of two years on unsupervised probation. A revocation warrant was issued, and following a hearing, the trial court found that the Defendant violated the conditions of his probation, revoked his probation, and ordered him to serve his sentences in confinement. On appeal, the Defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering him to serve his sentences in confinement. Following our review, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.",
        "The Defendant, Olajowon D. Smith, entered guilty pleas to one count of possession of 0.5 ounces or more of marijuana with the intent to deliver, a Class E felony, and one count of unlawful possession of a weapon, a Class C misdemeanor. Although the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (\"TBI\") provided a certification that the Defendant had no prior convictions disqualifying him from eligibility for diversion, the trial court found that he had previously served time in confinement for a Class A misdemeanor and that he was accordingly ineligible for diversion. The court sentenced the Defendant to an aggregate eighteen-month sentence, with sixty days to be served in confinement and the remainder on probation. The Defendant appeals, challenging the trial court's determination that his prior conviction was a Class A rather than a Class C misdemeanor and its failure to weigh the appropriate diversionary factors. We conclude that the evidence does not preponderate against the trial court's findings and that the trial court was not required to consider the diversionary factors once it determined the Defendant was ineligible for diversion, and we affirm the judgment.",
        "The Defendant, Antonio Maurice Jackson, was convicted of three counts of second degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault after a bench trial. The trial court merged the homicide offenses and imposed an aggregate sentence of twenty-five years in prison. On appeal, the Defendant challenges the trial court's decision to admit the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness the trial court's various evidentiary decisions the trial court's rulings on self-defense the trial court's refusal to require the State to make an election on various charges the trial court's decision to convict the Defendant of second degree murder in Count 3 after announcing a verdict of acquittal from the bench and entering it in the minutes and the sentencing determination. After a thorough review of the record, we conclude that the principles of double jeopardy prohibited the trial court from revisiting its acquittal, and we accordingly reverse the Defendant's conviction for second degree murder in Count 3. The Defendant's remaining convictions and sentences are affirmed.",
        "The Petitioner, Johnathan Robert Leonard, sought post-conviction relief from his convictions of three counts of rape of a child, two counts of soliciting sexual exploitation of a minor, and one count of aggravated sexual battery, for which he received an effective ninety-six-year sentence. Relevant to this appeal, he alleged that counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to adequately meet and confer with him, preserve for appeal several issues related to prosecutorial misconduct during trial proceedings, and appeal his sentence. See Johnathan Robert Leonard v. State, No. M2018-01737-CCA-R3-PC, 2019 WL 5885085, at 1 (Tenn. Crim. App. Nov. 12, 2019), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Mar. 26, 2020). Following a hearing, the post-conviction court granted the Petitioner relief in the form of a delayed appeal regarding his claim that counsel was ineffective in failing to appeal his sentence, but this court reversed and remanded for adjudication of the Petitioner's remaining allegations. Id. at 9. On remand, the post-conviction court denied the Petitioner's remaining claims after a second evidentiary hearing. The Petitioner appeals, maintaining that counsel failed to adequately meet and confer with him and to preserve for appeal claims related to prosecutorial misconduct. We affirm the post-conviction court's judgment.",
        "The Defendant, James Rodney Smith, was convicted of arson following a jury trial, and he was sentenced to four years on probation and ordered to pay $15,000 in restitution. No appeal was filed, and the Defendant sought post-conviction relief and was permitted to file a delayed motion for a new trial and appeal. James Rodney Smith v. State, No. M2019-00820-CCA-R3-PC, 2020 WL 3832996, at 6 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 8, 2020) (reversing the post-conviction court's denial of post-conviction relief and remanding for a hearing on due process tolling), no perm. app. filed. On appeal of the conviction, the Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, the unanimity of the jury verdict, and the restitution order. After review, we affirm the trial court's judgment.",
        "The Petitioner, Christopher C. Solomon, pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicular homicide, aggravated vehicular assault, and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, and he received an effective thirty-three-year sentence. The Petitioner filed a petition for post-conviction relief, contending that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when trial counsel failed to seek the trial judge's recusal at sentencing. Following a hearing, the post-conviction court denied the petition, and the Petitioner appeals. After review, we affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.",
        "The Defendant, Tadarius L. Clift, appeals his convictions for first degree premeditated murder and three counts of reckless endangerment, for which he received an effective sentence of life imprisonment plus four years. On appeal, the Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the convictions and the trial court's decision to limit defense counsel's cross-examination of a witness for the State. Upon reviewing the record, the parties' briefs, and the applicable law, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.",
        "The Petitioner, Antonio Bonds, was convicted by a jury of first degree premeditated murder, and he received a sentence of life imprisonment. The Petitioner filed this fourth petition for post-conviction relief over twenty years after his conviction, and the postconviction court summarily dismissed his petition on the ground that the statute of limitations barred its consideration of his claims. The Petitioner appeals. After review, we affirm the post-conviction court's judgment pursuant to Rule 20 of the Rules of the Court of Criminal Appeals.",
        "On October 12, 2018, a Shelby County jury convicted the Defendant, David Johnson, of aggravated rape committed in February 2000, based on DNA evidence linking him to the crime. On appeal, the Defendant asserts that he is entitled to have the conviction reversed and dismissed because he was not timely indicted. He also argues that the State failed to establish the chain of custody of the DNA evidence. We conclude that the Defendant was timely indicted through a \"John Doe\" indictment and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the chain of custody was adequately established for the DNA evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment.",
        "The Petitioner, Jessie Dotson, appeals the post-conviction court's denial of his postconviction petition, in which he challenged his six convictions for first degree premeditated murder and three convictions for attempted first degree murder and his resulting sentences of death for each of the first degree murder convictions plus 120 years. On appeal, the Petitioner contends that (1) he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal (2) the Administrative Office of the Courts (\"AOC\") and the Chief Justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court improperly vacated the post-conviction court's orders granting the Petitioner's request for funding of experts (3) the convictions and death sentences were the result of juror misconduct (4) the State and the trial court committed various errors (5) the Petitioner's convictions and death sentences and Tennessee's execution method are unconstitutional and (6) cumulative error warrants relief. Upon reviewing the record, the parties' briefs and oral arguments, and the applicable law, we affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.",
        "The Defendant, Corey Allen Harris, was convicted after a jury trial of attempted second degree murder, aggravated assault, and employment of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony, and he received an effective eighteen-year sentence. The Defendant filed a motion for a new trial asserting that the evidence was insufficient and that the prosecutor's argument was so improper as to constitute plain error. On appeal, the Defendant renews the challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and the prosecutor's closing argument, and he asks for relief based on the omission from the jury instructions of the statutory definition of attempt. Because the jury was not properly instructed on the elements of the offense of attempted second degree murder, we reverse the convictions for attempted second degree murder and employment of a firearm during the commission of attempted second degree murder, and we remand for further proceedings. The aggravated assault conviction is affirmed.",
        "The Petitioner, DeMarco Waters, appeals the denial of post-conviction relief with respect to his convictions for one count of first degree premeditated murder, three counts of attempted first degree murder, one count of attempted second degree murder, and four counts of employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony, for which he received an effective sentence of life imprisonment plus seventy-seven years.

        "The Petitioner, Nathan Scarborough, pleaded guilty to aggravated child abuse of a child eight years of age or less and second degree murder, and he received an effective thirty-three-year sentence. The Petitioner filed a petition for post-conviction relief, contending that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that he did not plead guilty knowingly and voluntarily. Following a hearing, the post-conviction court denied the petition, and the Petitioner appeals. After review, we affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.",
        "The Petitioner, Seddrick Curry, pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated burglary, one count of theft of property valued at $10,000 or more but less than $60,000, and one count of theft of property valued at $1,000 or more but less than $10,000, and he was sentenced to an effective thirty-year period of incarceration. The Petitioner filed a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas, claiming that his pleas were not knowingly and voluntarily entered due, in part, to the ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court denied the Petitioner's motion, and the trial court's decision was affirmed on appeal. The Petitioner then petitioned for post-conviction relief on the basis that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The post-conviction court denied his petition, and the Petitioner appeals. After review, we conclude that the issue presented on appeal has been previously determined, and we affirm the denial of post-conviction relief.",
        "A jury convicted the Defendant, Eric Dewayne Wallace, of first degree felony murder and attempted first degree murder for offenses committed in 1992, and he was sentenced to consecutive terms of life imprisonment and fifteen years. After discovering in 2021 that the Defendant was mistakenly assigned 1,174 days of pretrial jail credit and 312 days of behavior credit to both convictions, the trial court entered an order and corrected judgment for the conviction for attempted first degree murder, removing the credits to correct a clerical error under Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. On appeal, the Defendant challenges the trial court's order on the basis that it abused its discretion, violated his due process rights and the prohibitions against double jeopardy, and failed to comply with Rule 17 of the Rules of the Tennessee Supreme Court and Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-209. After review, we affirm the trial court's judgment.",
        "A jury convicted the Defendant, Kentrel Ne'Air Siner, of simple possession of oxycodone, simple possession of marijuana, and possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony crime of violence, and he received an effective ten-year sentence. The convictions were the result of a search of the vehicle in which the Defendant was a passenger and the discovery of marijuana and oxycodone in the center console, a marijuana cigarette on the passenger floorboard, and a weapon under the passenger's seat. On appeal, the Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, arguing that there was nothing beyond proximity to tie him to the items recovered. After a thorough review of the record, we conclude that the evidence is insufficient to uphold his convictions for possession of oxycodone and possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony crime of violence, and these convictions are reversed and the charges dismissed. The conviction for simple possession of marijuana is affirmed.",
        "The Defendant, Timothy Prink, appeals the trial court's summary denial of his motion to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.1 in which he challenged his fifteen-year sentence resulting from his attempted first degree murder conviction and his four life sentences resulting from four first degree murder convictions. After review, we affirm the trial court's judgment.",
        "The Defendant, Cleotris Ruben, entered guilty pleas pursuant to North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), to one count of theft of property valued more than $1,000 but less than $2,500, a Class E felony, and one count of theft of property valued $1,000 or less, a Class A misdemeanor. After entry of the pleas but prior to sentencing, the Defendant discovered that, contrary to what he had been told by the two attorneys representing him, he was not eligible for judicial diversion. The Defendant moved to withdraw his guilty pleas, and the trial court denied the motion. On appeal, this court concluded that counsel had a conflict of interest and reversed the decision, remanding for appointment of new counsel. The trial court appointed new counsel, held a hearing, and again denied the Defendant's motion to withdraw his pleas, and the Defendant appeals. We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion, and we reverse and remand the case for entry of an order permitting withdrawal of the pleas and for further proceedings.",
        "The Petitioner, Perry Brent Lanham, pleaded guilty to burglary and theft of property valued $2,500 or more, and he received an effective eight-year sentence on probation supervised by community corrections. The Petitioner filed a petition for post-conviction relief, contending that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that he did not plead guilty knowingly and voluntarily. Following a hearing, the post-conviction court denied the petition, and the Petitioner appeals. We affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.",
        "John Everett Williams, P.J., dissenting.I respectfully disagree with the majority's conclusion that this court is without jurisdiction to hear the appeal because no final judgment has been entered.Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(b) provides that a criminal defendant has \"a right to appeal when the trial court has entered a final judgment of conviction.\" State v. Comer, 278 S.W.3d 758, 760-61 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2008) (quotation omitted). However, \"'Rule 3 appeals \u2026 may be taken only from final judgments.'\" State v. William Chandler Daniels, No. E2009-02172-CCA-R3-CD, 2010 WL 5343776, at 1 (Tenn. Crim. App. Dec. 23, 2010) (quoting State v. Maddox, 603 S.W.2d 740, 741 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1980)). A judgment is considered final \"'when it decides and disposes of the whole merits of the case leaving nothing for the further judgment of the court.'\" State v. David Allan Bohanon, No. M2012-02366-CCA-R3-CD, 2013 WL 5777254, at 3 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 25, 2013) (quoting Richardson v. Tenn. Bd. of Dentistry, 913 S.W.2d 446, 460 (Tenn. 1995)).",
        "The Petitioner, Stacy L. Curry, entered a guilty plea to aggravated sexual battery and received an agreed-upon sentence of twenty years in prison. He filed various post-judgment motions, including the petition for post-conviction relief at issue on this appeal. The post-conviction court dismissed the petition, and the Petitioner appeals, asserting he was entitled to a hearing. Because the record is inadequate to allow review of the basis of the post-conviction court's dismissal, we conclude any challenge is waived and affirm the dismissal.",
        "A jury convicted the Defendant, Benjamin Barton, of driving under the influence of an intoxicant (\"DUI\"), driving with a blood alcohol level in excess of 0.08 percent (\"DUI per se\"), and reckless driving. The trial court sentenced him to an effective sentence of eleven months and twenty-nine days, with six months to be served in confinement. The Defendant moved for a new trial and for the trial court to reconsider his sentence under Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, and the motions were denied. On appeal, the Defendant asserts that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdicts, that he is entitled to a mistrial due to a discovery violation regarding expert testimony on retrograde extrapolation, that the trial court abused its discretion in failing suspend his sentence due to his health, and that there are errors on the judgment forms. We conclude that the Defendant is not entitled to relief on his convictions but that the sentencing forms are in conflict with the trial court's oral judgments, and we remand for the trial court to correct the forms.",
        "The Defendant, Destiny Hall, was convicted at trial of evading arrest through the use of a motor vehicle, and she received aone-year sentence, suspended to probation supervised by community corrections after service of thirty days in confinement.

        "In 2012, the Defendant, David Herl, entered a guilty plea to theft of property valued over $1,000, and he received a sentence of four years, suspended to probation. On July 2, 2013, a warrant was issued, alleging that the Defendant violated the terms of his probation. The warrant was not served on the Defendant until September 18, 2020. The Defendant moved to dismiss the prosecution, asserting that his right to a speedy trial had been violated. The trial court refused to dismiss the proceedings, found the Defendant to have violated the terms of his probation, and ordered the Defendant to serve his sentence in confinement. The Defendant appeals the trial court's refusal to dismiss the charges. We conclude that the Defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated and affirm the trial court's judgment.",
        "The Defendant, Terrance B. Smith, appeals the trial court's summary denial of his motion to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.1 in which he challenged his life sentence resulting from his first degree murder conviction for an offense that occurred in 1998. After review, we affirm the trial court's judgment.",
        "The Defendant, Brandon Banks, pleaded guilty to first degree murder and aggravated cruelty to animals, and he received an effective life sentence. He filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.1, asserting that his life sentence is illegal because it is equivalent to a sentence of life without parole or a sentence of death. The trial court summarily denied relief, and the Defendant appeals. Because the Defendant did not raise a colorable claim for relief under Rule 36.1, we affirm the trial court's judgment.",
        "The Defendant, Juan LaSean Perry, appeals the trial court's summary denial of his motion to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.1 in which he challenged his twenty-five-year sentence resulting from his second degree murder conviction in 2005.

        "The Petitioner, James Dominic Stevenson, was convicted by a jury of attempted first degree murder, three counts of aggravated assault, and reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon after he shot his ex-girlfriend in her car in the presence of her child. His aggravated assault convictions were merged into the attempted first degree murder conviction, and he received an effective twenty-seven-year sentence. The Petitioner filed for post-conviction relief, asserting that he received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel, and his petition was denied after a hearing. On appeal, we affirm the denial of post-conviction relief.",
        "The Petitioner, Jeffrey Wayne Hughes, entered open guilty pleas to one count of theft of $250,000 or more, one count of theft of $10,000 or more but less than $60,000, and six counts of money laundering, and he received an effective twenty-seven-year sentence. He filed a petition for post-conviction relief, asserting that his pleas were involuntary because the aggregation of the theft offenses violated the prohibition on ex post facto laws and asserting that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The post-conviction court denied relief, and he appeals. We conclude that the Petitioner's pleas were not involuntary because there was no ex post facto violation and that he has not established that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of relief.",
        "A jury convicted the Defendant, Homer Alson Maddin, III, of four counts of aggravated rape in 2004, and the trial court sentenced him to concurrent terms of twenty-five years in confinement. After discovering in 2020 that it mistakenly marked the Defendant as a violent offender rather than a multiple rapist on the judgment forms in counts two through four, the trial court entered an order amending the judgment forms under Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. On appeal, the Defendant argues that the trial court failed to provide proper notice under Rule 36 and that his classification as a violent offender was not a clerical error. After review, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.",
        "The Petitioner, Donald Jones, was found guilty by a jury of first degree felony murder and especially aggravated burglary, and he received an effective sentence of life imprisonment plus thirty years. After this court affirmed the Petitioner's convictions on direct appeal, he filed a petition for post-conviction relief contending that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to locate and interview an alibi witness and failed to request an instruction on accomplice testimony. Following a hearing, the post-conviction court denied the petition. After review, we affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.",
        "A jury convicted the Defendant, Mickey Verchell Shanklin, of the sale of heroin, the delivery of heroin, the sale of fentanyl, and the delivery of fentanyl and assessed fines of $50,000 for the heroin convictions and $25,000 for the fentanyl convictions. The trial court merged the heroin convictions and the fentanyl convictions and ordered the Defendant to serve concurrent terms of thirty years for the heroin convictions and fifteen years for the fentanyl convictions as a Range III, persistent offender at forty-five percent. The trial court also affirmed the total fines of $75,000. On appeal, the Defendant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions and that the fines are excessive. We remand the case to the trial court for a hearing with regard to the fines. We otherwise affirm the judgments of the trial court.",
        "A jury convicted the Defendant, Dejavone Lee Woods, of attempted voluntary manslaughter and employing a firearm in the attempted commission of a dangerous offense, and he received an effective ten-year sentence. On appeal, the Defendant asserts that the State failed to negate self-defense, that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay evidence, that the trial court erred in admitting testimony about a surveillance video, that the trial court erred in refusing to give an instruction on misdemeanor reckless endangerment, and that he is entitled to cumulative error relief. After a review of the record, we conclude that the Defendant is not entitled to appellate relief and affirm the judgments.",
        "A jury convicted the Defendant, Torijon Coplin, of aggravated assault and tampering with evidence, and he received an effective sentence of four years suspended to supervised probation after eleven months and twenty-nine days of service. On appeal, the Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions and argues the trial court erred in charging the jury as to criminal responsibility. Because the criminal responsibility charge did not include the natural and probable consequences requirement and because the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to the tampering with evidence conviction, we reverse the conviction for tampering with evidence and remand for further proceedings. The judgments are otherwise affirmed.",
        "The Defendant, Sharod Winford Moore, was convicted by a jury of first degree premeditated murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. In the first direct appeal, this court found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction but that the Defendant waived all other issues for failure to file a timely motion for new trial. The Defendant was subsequently granted a delayed appeal. He now argues that (1) the trial court erred in allowing the State to present unfairly prejudicial evidence of his alleged gang membership, (2) the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by making inflammatory and prejudicial remarks about his alleged gang membership in closing argument, (3) the trial court erred in not allowing evidence of the victim's propensity for intoxication and violence, and (4) the trial court erred in determining that a State's intellectually disabled witness was competent to testify. We affirm the conviction.",
        "The Defendant, Angela Kilgore, was convicted by a jury of first degree premeditated murder, first degree felony murder, especially aggravated robbery, aggravated arson, and theft of property valued $2,500 or more but less than $10,000. After merging the felony murder conviction into the premeditated murder conviction, the trial court sentenced the Defendant to an effective term of life plus eighty years in the Department of Correction. On appeal, the Defendant argues that the trial court erred by overruling her motion to suppress the results of the search of her pickup truck, the evidence was insufficient to sustain her convictions for first degree murder, aggravated arson and especially aggravated robbery, her dual convictions for especially aggravated robbery and theft violate principles of double jeopardy, and the trial court erred in ordering consecutive sentences. We affirm the judgments of the trial court but remand for a corrected judgment in count six to reflect that the theft conviction merges into the conviction for especially aggravated robbery.",
        "The Petitioner, Ray Armstrong, was convicted after a jury trial of two counts of sale of 0.5 grams or more of cocaine in a drug-free school zone, two counts of delivery of 0.5 grams or more of cocaine in a drug-free school zone, tampering with evidence, and resisting arrest. The drug charges were merged, and the Petitioner was sentenced to serve an effective sentence of fifty and one-half years in prison. He filed a timely post-conviction petition, alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The post-conviction court held a hearing and denied relief, and the Petitioner appeals, asserting that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to inform the Petitioner of his sentencing exposure, failing to review relevant discovery with him, failing to call a witness, and waiving on appeal the trial court's refusal to instruct on a lesser included offense. We conclude that with respect to each claim, the Petitioner has either failed to establish deficiency or has failed to establish prejudice, and we affirm the denial of relief.",
        "The Defendant, Derious Grandberry, was convicted at trial of carjacking and aggravated robbery. He received an effective sentence of twenty years in confinement. On appeal, the Defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the offenses, that the trial court erred by failing to weigh the evidence itself as the thirteenth juror, that the trial court erred in allowing the State to admit the victim's photographic lineup identification of him into evidence, and that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing the maximum sentence. After review, we affirm the trial court's judgments.",
        "The Defendant, Gary Bush, appeals the trial court's summary denial of his motion to correct an illegal sentence filed pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.1 in which he challenged his life sentence resulting from his first degree murder conviction in 2008 for an offense that occurred in 1982. On appeal, the Defendant argues that he was sentenced under the 1989 Criminal Sentencing Reform Act rather than the law in effect when he committed the offense. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.",
        "The Defendant, George H. Person, pled guilty to two counts of driving after having been declared a motor vehicle habitual offender (\"MVHO\"), two counts of driving on a canceled, suspended, or revoked license, and a violation of the light law. The Defendant's sentencing took place after an amendment to the statute that was the basis of his MVHO conviction went into effect, so that the Defendant's conduct was no longer criminalized and, concomitantly, triggered no penalty. The trial court ruled that the Defendant was entitled to the lesser penalty of the amended statute under Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-11-112, and the State appeals. We conclude that the savings statute applies and that the Legislature's act of removing punishment for the offense constitutes a lesser penalty. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgments.",
        "In 1997, a jury convicted the Petitioner, Montez Adams, of first degree felony murder, especially aggravated burglary, conspiracy to commit especially aggravated burglary, and theft over $500, and he received an effective life sentence. On appeal, this court vacated the conviction for especially aggravated burglary and ordered the entry of a conviction for aggravated burglary and an accompanying ten-year sentence. State v. Montez Antuan Adams, et. al., No. 02C01-9709-CC-00352, 1998 WL 556174, at 1, 2 n.1 (Tenn. Crim. App. Sept. 1, 1998), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Apr. 5, 1999). In the following years, the Petitioner litigated post-judgment motions, including a petition for post-conviction relief. It appears that a new judgment form reflecting the Petitioner's conviction for aggravated burglary rather than especially aggravated burglary was not entered until 2019. Subsequently, the Petitioner filed this instant second petition for post-conviction relief, asserting that the new judgment form reset the statute of limitations with regard to his claims of post-conviction relief. The post-conviction court dismissed the petition, concluding that it was not timely and that the claims had been either previously determined or waived. We conclude that the delayed entry of the corrected judgment, as mandated by this court in 1998, does not permit the Petitioner to relitigate the post-conviction claims raised in his petition. Accordingly, the dismissal is affirmed.",

        "A jury convicted the Defendant, Stanley Jefferson, of aggravated rape, two counts of especially aggravated burglary, aggravated assault, and theft of property valued at more than $1,000, and he received an effective sentence of fifty-eight years. The sole issue raised on appeal is the sufficiency of the convicting evidence for the aggravated rape conviction. We conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the jury's verdict, and we affirm the convictions. We remand for any further proceedings necessary to correct an error in the sentence related to the Defendant's theft conviction.",
        "I agree with the majority's opinion that based upon the current status of caselaw, the indictment was not duplicitous and the resulting verdict did not violate the Defendant's right to a unanimous jury. However, I write separately to emphasize that while the language in the indictment and the resulting verdict were not unconstitutional, the practice employed by the State in drafting the indictment and by the trial court in failing to provide an enhanced unanimity instruction also is not advisable.",
        "A jury convicted the Defendant of driving under the influence of an intoxicant, driving in excess of the speed limit, and violating the light law, and he received an effective sentence of eleven months and twenty-nine days, with the sentence to be suspended after fourteen days in confinement. On appeal, the Defendant asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress certain statements made to law enforcement. After a review of the record, we conclude that the Defendant was not in custody under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), and we affirm the judgments.",
        "The Defendant, Demon L. Adkins, was convicted after a jury trial of two counts of possessing contraband in a penal institution, and he received an effective fifteen-year sentence as a career offender. On appeal, the Defendant argues that his convictions are invalid because the indictment erroneously stated the incorrect mens rea and because the verdict forms and jury instructions conflated the crime of possessing contraband in a penal institution and introducing contraband into a penal institution. He also asserts that the savings statute operates to entitle him to a lesser punishment. We conclude that he is not entitled to reversal of his convictions but that the savings statute applies to provide a lesser penalty. Accordingly, the convictions are affirmed, the sentences are reversed, and the case is remanded for resentencing.",

He received an effective sentence of four years in confinement followed by eight years on community corrections. On appeal, the Defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of possession of a firearm with intent to go armed during the commission of a dangerous felony, that the trial court violated his right to confront the State's witness during cross-examination, and that the State improperly commented on his decision not to testify in its closing argument. After reviewing the record, the parties' briefs, and the applicable law, we affirm the trial court's judgments.",

See State v. Shenessa L. Sokolosky, --- S.W.3d. ---, No. M2022-00873-SC-R11-CD, 2025 WL 2016420 (Tenn. July 18, 2025) (reversing State v. Shenessa L.

This court concluded in its previous opinion that the Defendant's appeal was moot because she had fully served her sentence and was no longer constrained by confinement or probation supervision. The Tennessee Supreme Court disagreed and concluded that the mootness doctrine does not apply because a probation revocation may result in future adverse consequences, even after completion of a sentence. Upon further review, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for further findings of fact pursuant to State v. Wade, 863 S.W.2d 406, 409 (Tenn. 1993).

The post-conviction court found that trial counsel \"was deficient for notrequesting applicable lesser-included jury instructions\" but found that \"Petitioner was notprejudiced as a result\" and denied relief. We determine that trial counsel's decision not torequest an instruction on lesser-included offenses was an \"informed choice based uponadequate preparation,\" Moore v. State, 485 S.W.3d 411, 420 (Tenn. 2016), and thatPetitioner failed to overcome the presumption that counsel provided adequate assistanceand used reasonable professional judgment to make the strategic decision to employ an\"all-or-nothing\" defense strategy. We agree with the post-conviction court's ruling thatPetitioner failed to prove the prejudice prong of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,687 (1984). Discerning no reversible error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.",

Because Petitioner failed to comply with the statutory requirements for seeking appellate review of the denial of the Motion to Re-open, we lack jurisdiction to consider the Motion. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-117(c).",
