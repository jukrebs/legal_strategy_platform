    "notes": "Judge Alan E. Glenn of the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals demonstrates a judicial philosophy rooted in procedural formalism and a high degree of deference to trial court outcomes. His written opinions are methodical and consistently apply established Tennessee statutes and precedent. He shows very little receptivity to novel legal arguments or policy-based reasoning, preferring a strict application of existing law. Appeals are frequently dismissed on procedural grounds, such as untimely filings or failure to adhere to jurisdictional requirements for certified questions of law. In criminal matters, his record indicates a strong tendency to affirm convictions, making him a challenging judge for appellants seeking to overturn a jury verdict or trial court ruling.",
