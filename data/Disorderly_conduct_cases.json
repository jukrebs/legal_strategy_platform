A city may prosecute disorderly conduct under its own ordinance when the ordinance does not supersede a state statute. A party may not challenge an error in the jury instruction on appeal when the party waived the issue before the district court. It is not necessary to state in an information the details of the acts which constitute the crime charged when the essential elements of the crime are set forth sufficiently to enable a person of common understanding to know what is meant or intended. One test of the sufficiency of an information is whether it will protect the accused against a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. A defendant in a criminal jury trial must move for a judgment of acquittal to preserve the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence for appeal. This Court may decline to review a forfeited error when the appellant fails to argue the obvious error standard."

Disorderly conduct is analyzed in the same manner for both civil and criminal cases because the reasonable grounds for a restraining order are synonymous with probable cause for an arrest. The elements of criminal disorderly conduct by harassment are the same as those required to prove disorderly conduct in the context of a petition for a restraining order. A petitioner for a disorderly conduct restraining order must prove his case before the district court in a full hearing.

Defendant's conviction for resisting arrest was supported by sufficient evidence and was not against the manifest weight of the evidence where there was a lawful basis for her arrest: defendant's conduct amounted to two arrestable offenses, criminal trespass and disorderly conduct, and the police officer's use of force after defendant's resistance did not demonstrate the affirmative defense of excessive force.

The defendant claimed, inter alia, that a certain statute (§ 54-94a) and rule of practice (§ 39-18) governing pleas of nolo contendere were unconstitutional because they violated the common-law presumption of innocence. Held: The defendant waived his claims that § 54-94a and Practice Book § 39-18 were unconstitutional, as his plea of nolo contendere operated as a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects and barred the later assertion of constitutional challenges to pretrial proceedings, and neither of his claims of error chal- lenged either the exercise of jurisdiction by the court or the voluntary and intelligent nature of his plea. This court declined to review the defendant's inadequately briefed claims that the charges against him lacked probable cause, that the trial court erred in not complying with the requirements of Practice Book § 39-18, that the court violated his due process rights by failing to hold a hearing on certain postjudgment motions and that the judges who presided over his case acted without authority. The defendant's claim that the trial court exceeded its authority by imposing terms to his conditional discharge was moot, as it was undisputed that this appeal was not heard until after his one year term of conditional discharge had expired, and there was no practical relief this court could provide to the defendant. Argued September 17—officially released November 19, 2024"

        "judge": "Suttell, Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, Indeglia",
        "syllabus": "The defendant, Mario Souto, appealed from a judgment of conviction on three counts—assault of a police officer, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct—following a two-day jury trial during which the defendant represented himself. On appeal, the defendant challenged the trial justice's finding that the defendant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to counsel prior to trial. Specifically, the defendant argued that the trial justice was required to conduct a separate inquiry into his indigency status before finding a valid waiver, and that the trial justice had not considered the fact that, when the defendant agreed to allow his attorney to withdraw, he had not understood that he would be required to represent himself at trial if he did not hire another attorney. The Supreme Court held that the trial justice did not err in finding that the defendant had voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to counsel prior to trial. The Court determined that the defendant's actions—his failure to obtain counsel after being afforded multiple continuances over fourteen months—demonstrated a voluntary waiver. Furthermore, the Court held that the trial justice did not err in concluding that the defendant had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel because the defendant had been warned about the consequences of his failure to hire an attorney at multiple times throughout the proceedings. The Court concluded that, based on the totality of the circumstances, the defendant had validly waived his right to counsel. Accordingly, the Court affirmed the judgment of conviction."

        "syllabus": "Rape gross sexual imposition kidnapping prosecutorial misconduct DNA analysis ineffective assistance of counsel character witness opinion testimony victim impact evidence harmless error plain error cumulative error. It is not misconduct for a prosecutor to refer to the defendant's specific acts during cross-examination of a character witness after the defendant put his character at issue. Such cross-examination may also include reference to defendant's prior arrest regardless of whether it lead to a conviction. Where the defendant was previously charged with domestic violence and convicted of disorderly conduct, it is a harmless error for the prosecutor to refer to an associated assault conviction that does not exist where such reference does not cause prejudice. There is no plain error where a court admits evidence of an inconclusive DNA analysis where evidence otherwise establishes defendant's guilt. The failure to make an objection, alone, is not enough to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel as part of a direct appeal cannot be predicated on evidence that is outside of the record. Lay witness opinion testimony about child-victims of sexual abuse is not improper where the testimony is rationally based on the witness' experience and is helpful to a determination of a fact in issue. There is no prejudicial error where a court admits evidence that the victim sought counseling after rape where the evidence was brief and not overly emotional or inflammatory. Where the conviction stands absent the testimony regarding counseling, its admission was harmless error. Where multiple harmless errors occurred at trial, but where defendant otherwise received a fair trial and defendant's guilt was established by overwhelming evidence there is no cumulative error."

In his petition, the petitioner sought permission to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming, inter alia, that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance. Held that the trial court properly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petition for a writ of error coram nobis; because the petitioner could have raised his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus during his period of probation, he failed to avail himself of an alternative legal remedy available to him; moreover, this court declined the petitioner's request that this court overrule State v. Stephenson (154 Conn. App. 587), which clearly held that the prior availability of a writ of habeas corpus defeats the jurisdiction of the trial court to entertain a petition for a writ of error coram nobis, the petitioner having failed to file a motion requesting that this court hear his appeal en banc.
